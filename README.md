# Fund Tsansfer system in C++

This project is designed to create a simple and interactive banking application that helps the user manage various financial activities in their bank account.

## 📄Description:

This project is a Fund Transfer System developed in C++. It allows users to check their account balance in their personal bank account. Users can deposit money into their account easily. They can also transfer funds to other accounts securely through the system. The application simulates a simple banking experience with basic functionalities.
## 💡 Key Concepts Used:

(i) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects to represent accounts and transactions.

(ii) Encapsulation: Keeping account data (balance, account number) private and accessible via functions.

(iii) Functions/Methods: For deposit, withdrawal, balance check, and fund transfer operations.

(iv) Conditional Statements & Loops: To handle user choices and input validation.

(v) File Handling (Optional): To save account information persistently (if implemented).
## ✨ Features:

* Check Account Balance: Users can view their current account balance anytime.

* Deposit Money: Easily add funds to the account.

* Fund Transfer: Send money securely to another user’s account.

* User-Friendly Menu: Simple interface to navigate between options.

* Transaction Validation: Ensures sufficient balance before transferring funds.
## 🔔 Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to simulate a simple banking system where users can manage their accounts. It allows users to check account balances, deposit money, and transfer funds securely to other accounts. The system helps users understand basic banking operations in a digital environment. It also demonstrates the use of C++ programming concepts in a real-world application. Overall, it provides a safe and interactive platform for handling personal finances.
## 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, and encapsulation.

2. Functions & Methods: Creating reusable code for deposit, transfer, and balance check.

3. Conditional Statements & Loops: Handling user choices and validating inputs.

4. Data Handling: Managing account balances and transactions effectively.

5. File Handling (Optional): Storing and retrieving account information permanently.
## ▶️ How to Run:

1. Open the project in a C++ IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev C++, or Visual Studio.

2. Compile the program to check for any errors.

3. Run the executable file or start the program from the IDE.

4. Follow the on-screen menu to check balance, deposit money, or transfer funds.

5. Enter your inputs carefully as prompted to perform transactions successfully.
